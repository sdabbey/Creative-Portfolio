# Creative Portfolio
This repository contains code for creating an immersive exhibition aimed at raising awareness about the harmful effects of galamsey - the illegal and unregulated small-scale mining practices that devastate communities and ecosystems in Ghana. This exhibition serves as both a plaform for activism and an exploration of the potential for art and technology to drive social change.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Gallery**: Navigate a virtual space where each artwork animates and zooms in for immersive viewing.
- **Exhibition Guide**: A central "frame" introduces the exhibitionâ€™s themes and provides tips for navigating the gallery.
- **Focus on Accessibility**: Designed to educate and inspire action against *galamsey*, in line with the philosophy that art should be both impactful and universally accessible.
